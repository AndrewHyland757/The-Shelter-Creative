The client had already used this font before for the company logo.

Sans-serif for Headings and Navigation: 
[Helvetica Now ](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/helvetica-now-variable-font-monotype-imaging?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPt9lteUZbeU0eapbzvWRKqirrfeP-TPfpJa1AQDZUr3y596Hq5TbyIaAqzbEALw_wcB) from myfonts.com, was selected for headings and navigation elements in the header. This modern update of the classic Helvetica offers improved legibility and a fresh aesthetic, perfectly complementing the website's contemporary design12. 

[Reckless Neue Book ](https://displaay.net/typeface/reckless-collection/reckless-neue/) from Displaay Type Foundry, was chosen for the primary body text. Its elevated x-height enhances readability while imparting a contemporary and refined feel, aligning well with the desired website personality3.

This combination of sans-serif for headings and serif for body text creates a balanced visual hierarchy, marrying modern design sensibilities with a touch of classic elegance. The contrast between the two typefaces adds visual interest while maintaining a cohesive and sophisticated overall appearance.

### Logo Design

#### Key Objectives and Features:
- Display the company's name prominently
- Maintain brand continuity
- Create a modern and sophisticated visual identity
- Ensure versatility across various applications



#### Execution
- Typography: After thorough consultations with the client regarding typography options, we ultimately decided to retain the original font, Big Noodle Too, in all uppercase. This choice honors the company's heritage, as it has been in use since the brand's inception. The selected font aligns perfectly with the overall tone and aesthetic of the website, providing a seamless visual experience.

- Sub-logo: To enhance the logo's impact, I proposed the addition of a sub-logo specifically for the website, to be placed beneath the main company logo. For the sub-logo, we chose Helvetica Now, a contemporary serif font that complements the primary logo while adding a fresh, modern touch. This combination creates a unique visual hierarchy, blending the refined sophistication of the main logo with the modern industrial feel of the sub-logo.


The contrast between the two typefaces adds depth and interest to the overall design, making it more memorable and visually appealing. The final logo design successfully balances tradition with innovation, creating a distinctive and versatile visual identity that effectively represents the company's brand across all platforms. It acts as a stamping mark on all pages of the website, reinforcing brand recognition and leaving a lasting impression on visitors.
