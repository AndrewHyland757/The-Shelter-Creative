### Landing Page
- A visually enticing landing page was created with a full screen image.
- This was done to capture user attention, foster an emotional connection, generate intrigue, and encourage further exploration of the website.
- The design also aligned with the overall brand identity, including color schemes and style. 
 
- The decision to leave out common features of a landing page such as a CTA button and text
 was made to preserve tone and personality.

### Header
- The header includes, the logo, sub-logo which includes emaillink, and a navigation link to the projects modal and info modal.


The header design deliberately deviated from conventional layouts by positioning the logo at the extreme left and navigation elements to the right. This unconventional approach achieved multiple design objectives:
- Bold Visual Statement: The asymmetrical layout creates a striking, original composition that immediately communicates the website's innovative and creative personality.
- Visual Hierarchy: The sparse, minimalist design allows imagery to become the focal point, drawing users' attention to the core visual content.
- Functional Elegance: Despite its unconventional placement, the navigation remains intuitive and easily accessible, balancing aesthetic innovation with user experience.

The strategic header design reflects a thoughtful approach to layout, where form follows function while simultaneously making a bold visual statement that aligns with the website's contemporary and refined aesthetic.

The header is implemented as an absolute element and using fullpage.js anchoring allows for easy colour changes between sections.
